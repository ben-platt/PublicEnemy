#### L02 -- All Hands on Deque!

## To-Do List
- [ ] Implement the methods that we wrote in the Dequeue interface.
- [ ] Include comments for both classes.
- [ ] Test and robustify the code!
- [ ] Update the ReadMe!

## Development Plan
1. Plan on the methods that we should implement based on the Java API entries. 
    1. **Think about which ones are easy to implement and which one are crucial.**
1. Put the methods we decide on into the Dequeue interface.
1. Create class QQKachoo which implements the Dequeue interface.
    1. **Which underlying data structure should we use?**
1. Test each method individually. Prioritize functionality. 
1. Update the ReadMe to provide the list of methods we decided to implement and rationality why we chose this underlying data structure.

## Methods
* public void addFirst(Card x);
* public void addLast(Card x);
* public Card removeFirst();
* public Card removeLast();
* public Card getFirst();
* public Card getLast();
